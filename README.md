# Lightweight Data Science Project Template

This is a lighter weight version of the [cookiecutter-data-science template](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) I created mainly for personal use on DS projects.

## Changes from the Original

* Simplified Makefile
* Changed Sphinx docs to pdoc3
* Removed tox.ini
* Changed requirements.txt to environment.yml for conda support

## Usage

`pip install cookiecutter` 

Navigate to directory you want your project to be created in

`cookiecutter https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/lightweight-ds-cookie.git` 

You will then be asked a series of questions, following which your directory will be created.
